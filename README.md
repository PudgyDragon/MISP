<h1>MISP</h1>
<p>This was originally meant to be a repo for my guides on how to implement MISP itself. However, after discovering MISP communities (and tearing down our own MISP for other reasons) I have found that you can join communities that already have a MISP instance stood up. If your organization is in any way government, I highly recommend you check out the NATO MISP community and apply to have your organization added as one that can access their feeds. Check out the different communities (including the NATO community) here: https://www.misp-project.org/communities/</p>
